# Modeling-ready COVID19 time-series for PA, by county 
Datasets on time-series evolution of COVID19 cases and deaths in Pennsylvania (PA), by county.  
** 6/9/2020: Data on Cases now come from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/live/us-counties.csv whereas Deaths come from https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Death-Data.aspx since PA Department of Health stopped publishing a list of cases in the format scraped by the bots that curated this data.      

# Download data into Python, as follows:
- `import pandas as pd`
- `PA_County_Deaths = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/menonpg/COVID19_PA/master/timeSeries_COVID19_Cases_PACounties.csv')`
- `PA_County_Cases = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/menonpg/COVID19_PA/master/timeSeries_COVID19_Deaths_PACounties.csv')`
- `PA_County_NegativeTests = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/menonpg/COVID19_PA/master/timeSeries_COVID19_NegativeTests_PACounties.csv')`
- Consider adding the `, engine='python')` or `, encoding="cp1252")` arguments to the pd.read.csv function in the event of utf-8 related errors
